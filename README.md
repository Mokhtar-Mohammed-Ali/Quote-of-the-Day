💡 Quotes Website
A simple and elegant website that displays inspirational quotes from famous authors and thinkers. With every button click, a new random quote appears along with its author, enhanced by smooth transition effects and a visually appealing background.

🎯 What I Learned
How to dynamically manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.

Creating and working with an array of objects to store structured data (quote text and author).

Implementing fade in/out transitions using CSS for a smooth user experience.

Generating random values and ensuring no immediate repetition.

Using linear gradients with RGBA for layered, semi-transparent backgrounds.

Writing clean, reusable, and maintainable code.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 – for structuring the content.

CSS3 – for styling, background gradients, and transition effects.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – for handling logic, random quote selection, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

High-quality background images – for aesthetic enhancement and mood setting (sunset, meditation, etc.).

🚀 Additional Notes
Future enhancements could include integrating a quote API, social media sharing buttons, or saving favorite quotes.

This project is perfect for beginners to practice DOM manipulation, transitions, and logic in JavaScript.
